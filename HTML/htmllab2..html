    <div><b>Indian Premier League</b></div>
    <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons,
     is a men's T20 franchise cricket league of India. It is annually contested by ten
      teams based out of seven Indian cities and three Indian states.[1][2] The league
       was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. Brijesh
        Patel is the incumbent chairman of IPL.[3] It is usually held annually in summer
         across India between March to May and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future
          Tours Programme.[4]

The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by
 average attendance among all sports leagues.[5] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting
  event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube.[6][7] The brand value of the IPL in
   2019 was ₹47,500 crore (US$5.9 billion), according to Duff & Phelps.[8] According to BCCI,
    the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the GDP of the Indian 
    economy.[9] [needs update]

So far there have been fifteen seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holder 
franchise is Gujarat Titans, winning the 2022 season.</p>

    <div><b>Expansions and terminations</b></div>
    <p>On 21 March 2010, two new franchises – Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala –
     joined the league before the fourth season in 2011.[22] Sahara Adventure Sports Group 
     bought the Pune franchise for $370 million while  Rendezvous Sports World bought the 
     Kochi franchise for $333.3 million.[22] However, one year later, on 11 November 2011
     , it was announced that the Kochi Tuskers Kerala side would be terminated following the
      side breaching the BCCI's terms of conditions.[23]

Then, on 14 September 2012, following the team not being able to find new owners, the BCCI
 announced that the 2009 champions, the Deccan Chargers, would be terminated.[24] The next
  month, on 25 October, an auction was held to see who would be the owner of the replacement
   franchise, with Sun TV Network winning the bid for the Hyderabad franchise.[25] The team
    would be named Sunrisers Hyderabad.[26]

Pune Warriors India withdrew from the IPL on 21 May 2013 over financial differences with the 
BCCI.[27] The franchise was officially terminated by the BCCI, on 26 October 2013, on account
 of the franchise failing to provide the necessary bank guarantee.[28]

On 14 June 2015, it was announced that two-time champions, Chennai Super Kings, and the 
 season champions, Rajasthan Royals, would be suspended for two seasons following their role
  in a spot-fixing and betting scandal.[29] Then, on 8 December 2015, following an auction, 
  it was revealed that Pune and Rajkot would replace Chennai and Rajasthan for two seasons.
  [30] The two teams were the Rising Pune Supergiant and the Gujarat Lions.[31]

The venue for the 2020 season was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic and games were played in
 the United Arab Emirates.[32][33] In August 2021, the BCCI announced that two new franchises 
would join the league starting from the 2022 season. It was also announced that the franchises 
would be based in two of the six cities shortlisted by the BCCI; Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Cuttack, 
Guwahati, Ranchi and Dharamshala.[34][35] In a closed
 bidding held on 25 October, RPSG Group and CVC Capital won bids for the two teams. RPSG paid 
₹7,000 crore (US$880 million) for Lucknow, whereas CVC won Ahmedabad for ₹5,200 crore (US$650 
million).[36][37] The teams were subsequently named Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans.</p>

    <p>IPL games utilise television timeouts and hence there is no time limit in which teams
     must complete their innings. However, a penalty may be imposed if the umpires find teams 
     misusing this privilege. Each team is given a two-and-a-half-minute "strategic timeout" 
     during each innings; one must be taken by the bowling team between the ends of the 6th 
     and 9th overs, and one by the batting team between the ends of the 13th and 16th overs.[44]

Since the 2018 season, the Umpire Decision Review System is being used in all IPL matches, 
allowing each team two chances to review an on-field umpire's decision per innings.[45]</p>

    <div><b>Title sponsorship</b></div><br>
    <q> I have honestly not stepped outside my house for three months, in the truest sense.
        I get my groceries and medical supplies delivered and get my dose of vitamin D from 
        the balcony. I wasn’t exactly antisocial before the pandemic, but my social 
        batteries did run out a lot quicker than others. I haven’t attended any birthday party 
        or wedding celebrations (and no quick visit to the mall or the movies) in the past
        3 months and I feel that I am not capable of human interactions anymore. 
        I am worried but also strangely relieved that I don’t have to dress up and make efforts
        to hold conversations anymore. It is scary, but I simply don’t want to go back 
        to pre-pandemic social routine.- Neha Anand, 32 (name changed to protect privacy)</q>
    <p>From 2008 to 2012, the title sponsor was DLF, India's largest real estate developer, who had secured the rights with a bid of ₹200 crore (US$25 million) for five seasons.[89] After the conclusion of the 2012 season, PepsiCo bought the title sponsorship rights for ₹397 crore (US$50 million) for the subsequent five seasons.[90] However, the company terminated the deal in October 2015, two years before the expiry of the contract, reportedly due to the two-season suspension of Chennai and Rajasthan franchises from the league.[91] The BCCI then transferred the title sponsorship rights for the remaining two seasons of the contract to Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo for ₹200 crore (US$25 million).[92] In June 2017, Vivo retained the rights for the next five seasons (2018–2022) with a winning bid of ₹2,199 crore (US$280 million), in a deal more expensive than Barclays' Premier League title sponsorship contract between 2013 and 2016.[93][94] On 4 August 2020, Vivo got out of the title sponsorship rights due to the ongoing military stand-off between India and China at the Line of Actual Control in July 2020.[95] It was also reported that the withdrawal was a result of Vivo's market losses due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation and that it intended to return as the title sponsors for the following 3 years.[96] Dream11 bagged the title sponsorship for the 2020 IPL for an amount of ₹222 crore.[97] Vivo returned as the title sponsor for the 2021 IPL,[98] but pulled out again, and was replaced by the Tata Group for the next 2 seasons.[99] InsideSport reported that the BCCI would actually receive ₹498 crore (US$62 million) for the 2022 and 2023 seasons from title sponsors. Vivo had previously agreed to pay a higher amount for the last two seasons of its sponsorship contract due to the expansion of the league from the 2022 season. According to InsideSport, the new deal had been structured such that Tata would pay ₹335 crore (US$42 million) per year while the deficit of ₹163 crore (US$20 million) per season would be paid by Vivo.[100][101]
